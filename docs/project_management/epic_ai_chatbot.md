# Epic: AI-Powered Chatbot

## 1. Overview

This epic describes the development of an AI-powered chatbot that is trained on server messages to provide a more engaging and personalized experience for users. The chatbot will be able to answer questions, participate in conversations, and learn from its interactions with users.

## 2. Objectives

*   **Increase User Engagement:** Create a fun and interactive feature that encourages users to participate in conversations.
*   **Provide Server-Specific Information:** The chatbot will be able to answer questions about the server, such as rules, events, and important announcements.
*   **Personalize the User Experience:** The chatbot will have a unique personality and tone that is tailored to the server's community.

## 3. Stories

*   **Story: Switch to Gemini Pro**
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I want to switch to the Gemini Pro model so that I can use a model that is more accessible and easier to get an API key for.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [x] Install the `@google/generative-ai` package.
        *   [x] Update `functions/ai.js` to use the Gemini Pro model.
        *   [x] Update `config.json` to include the Gemini Pro API key.

*   **Story: Basic Chatbot**
    *   **Description:** As a user, I want to be able to have a basic conversation with the chatbot so that I can get to know it and have some fun.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [x] Integrate with a large language model (LLM) API (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI).
        *   [x] Create a command to trigger the chatbot (e.g., `/chat`).
        *   [x] Implement a basic conversation loop.

*   **Story: Server-Specific Knowledge**
    *   **Description:** As a user, I want the chatbot to be able to answer questions about the server so that I can get information quickly and easily.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [x] Create a system for feeding server messages to the LLM.
        *   [x] Fine-tune the LLM on the server's chat history.
        *   [ ] Create a command to ask the chatbot questions about the server (e.g., `/ask`).

*   **Story: Personality and Tone**
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I want to be able to customize the chatbot's personality and tone so that it fits in with the server's community.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [ ] Create a configuration file for setting the chatbot's personality and tone.
        *   [ ] Allow server administrators to modify the configuration.

*   **Story: Usage and Rate Limiting**
    *   **Description:** As a developer, I want to implement usage and rate limiting for the chatbot so that it is not abused.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   [ ] Set a limit on the number of requests a user can make per day.
        *   [ ] Implement a cooldown period between requests.

## 4. Technical Requirements

*   **Platform:** Node.js
*   **Libraries:**
    *   `discord.js`: For interacting with the Discord API.
    *   An LLM API client (e.g., `openai`, `@google-ai/generativelanguage`).
*   **Database:** A database will be required to store the server's chat history.

## 5. Potential Risks and Mitigations

*   **Risk:** The chatbot could generate inappropriate or offensive responses.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a content moderation system to filter out inappropriate responses. Allow server administrators to blacklist certain words or phrases.
*   **Risk:** The LLM API could be expensive.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement usage and rate limiting to control costs. Allow server administrators to set a budget for the chatbot.
*   **Risk:** The chatbot could be slow to respond.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use a high-performance LLM and optimize the code for speed.
